VCMI - Android
--------------

VCMI is work-in-progress attempt to recreate engine for Heroes of Might and Magic III, giving it new and extended possibilities.

This is an VCMI port for Android. To play it, you need to use your own, legally acquired Heroes of Might and Magic III data files.

Installation: Copy "Data" "Maps" and "Mp3" folders from your original HoMM III installation to "<internal storage>/vcmi-data/".

Note: extra display resolutions and random map generation templates are only available with official "essentials" mod: https://wiki.vcmi.eu/Mod_list#Utilities

"Essentials" installation: copy "Mods/vcmi/Mods" folder from the archive to the root of your VCMI installation ("<internal storage>/vcmi-data"). Mods should appear in the game launcher "mods" section.
